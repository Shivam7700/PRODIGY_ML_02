For the Kaggle Mall Customer dataset, I applied the K-means clustering algorithm to unveil patterns and segments within the customer data. The dataset consists of variables such as customer ID, gender, age, annual income, and spending score. By employing K-means, I grouped customers based on their spending behavior, revealing distinct segments. The outcomes of the clustering analysis were illustrated using Matplotlib and Seaborn to create informative visualizations, aiding in the comprehension and communication of the findings. This project serves as an example of utilizing machine learning for customer segmentation on a Kaggle dataset, coupled with effective data visualization techniques for clear interpretation.
